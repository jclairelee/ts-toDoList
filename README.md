# To-Do-List
[ToDos Demo](https://claire-todo.netlify.app) | [Claire's Portfolio](https://jclairelee.com)

This TypeScript mini project serves as a foundational task management application with current features for task creation, deletion, and marking tasks as completed in its initial stage. Data management utilizes LocalStorage temporarily, with future plans to integrate more secure and robust data storage options. The project is designed to evolve with the addition of more complex features in subsequent stages.

## Improvement Plan

Future updates will transform this simple To-Do-List into a comprehensive task management system aimed at enhancing efficiency:

  - Task Organization: Implement task organization based on priority using drag-and-drop functionality and sortable lists, leveraging libraries like Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions.

  - Task Tracking and Monitoring: Enhance task tracking and monitoring features with real-time updates and notifications using WebSocket technology (e.g., Socket.io) for seamless communication between client and server. Optionally, include a Habit Tracker feature to monitor and maintain daily routines.

  - Analytics and Reporting: Develop analytical tools using data visualization libraries such as Chart.js or D3.js to provide insights into task completion rates, productivity trends, and performance metrics. This will require further research and implementation to integrate effectively.

  - Security and Data Protection: Strengthen security measures with HTTPS encryption, secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth2), and backend frameworks like Node.js/Express.js for authentication and authorization.
